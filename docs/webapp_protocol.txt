Stone Tools - webapp protocol

The webapp controls the communication between Teacher and disciples. This
communication occurs using signals that comply with the webapp protocol. In
the protocol, a machine can send, remove, and receive signals. When a
machine sends a signal, that signal is visible to both parties until the
sender removes the signal. Accepting a signal does not remove a signal. The
party sending the signal does not know that signal was received. Instead,
the receiving end sends another signal, a 'verified' signal, to let the
sending party know that the signal was received.

Why this silliness? To keep a stable and sound state.

The signals:
  'exist'
  'exist_verified'
  'arm'
  'arm_verified'
  'record'
  'record_verified'

In the perspective of webapp:
  disciple exists    <==> 'exist_verified' received
  disciple armed     <==> disciple exists and 'arm_verified' received
  disciple recording <==> disciple armed and 'record_verified' received

In the perspective of disciple:
  webapp exists          <==> 'exist_verified' received
  webapp signaled arm    <==> webapp exists and 'arm' received
  webapp signaled record <==> webapp signaled arm and 'record' received

Main Loop:
 forever:
  1) disciple sends    'exist' when it finds HD PVR
  2) webapp   receives 'exist'
  3) webapp   sends    'exist_verified'
  4) disciple receives 'exist_verified'
  5) disciple removes  'exist'
  6) webapp   sends    'arm'
  7) disciple receives 'arm' and arms itself
  8) disciple sends    'arm_verified'
  9) webapp   receives 'arm_verified'
 10) webapp   removes  'arm'
 11) webapp   sends    'record'
 12) disciple receives 'record' and begins recording
 13) disciple sends    'record_verified'
 14) webapp   receives 'record_verified'
 15) webapp   removes  'record' when want to stop recording
 16) webapp   removes  'exist_verified'
 17) disciple removes  'arm_verified'
 18) disciple removes  'record_verified'
