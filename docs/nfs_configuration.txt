teacher:
teacher is the NFS server.  It has two main config files:

/etc/exports
    Controls which directory gets defined as the directory that disciples can
    mount.  Each line is formatted as such:
        <directory> <disciple1 ip>(<permissions>)
	<directory> <disciple2 ip>(<permissions>)
    <directory> is the directory we are allowing the disciples to mount.  This
        should be the directory apache is serving to the web.
    <discipleN ip> is the IP address of each disciple.
    <permissions> is rw, allowing both read and write access to each disciple.
        They need both read and write permissions to function, at a minimum.

    <discipleN ip> will be most commonly changed, each IP must be the address
    of one of the disciples.

/etc/hosts.allow
    This file allows certain IP addresses to connect to our NFS server, but it
    only allows those we specify.  This single line takes the format:
        portmap: <disciple1 ip> , <disciple2 ip>, ...
    To allow access to each disciple, simply add/change the IPs on this line
    to the IPs they each use.

disciple:
The only file in disciple that affects the NFS share is /etc/fstab.

/etc/fstab
    This file changes where the disciple looks for an NFS server and how it
    attempts to mount the share.  It takes the format:
        <teacher ip>:/<teacher shared directory> <mount point> <type> <options>
    
    <teacher ip> is the IP address assigned to teacher, our NFS server.
    <teacher shared directory> is the directory on teacher that we decided
        to share with the disciples.
    <mount point> is the directory on the disciple where we want to mount the 
        remote drive (the one on teacher)
    <type> is the type of mount we are doing, in this case, "nfs" sans quotes
    <options> should always be: "hard,intr,actimeo=0", sans quote marks

After these options are reconfigured, teacher must (at a minimum) restart the
NFS server, and the disciples must reboot.

To restart the NFS server on teacher:
   sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart

To reboot the disciples:
   sudo reboot

After these take place, all should be well!
